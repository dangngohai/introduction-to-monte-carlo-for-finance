[17]). To avoid problems arising from corre- lating normally distributed increments (of $S$) with chi-squared distributed increments (of $v$), we will in the following only consider Euler schemes for both the $S$ and $v$ process. This has the advantage that the increments of $v$ become normally distributed as well and can therefore be easily correlated with the increments of $S$.\n",
