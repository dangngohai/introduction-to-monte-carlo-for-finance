    "Uncertain future exposure can be visualized by means of exposure profiles. These profiles are obtained by calculating certain statistics of the exposure distribution at each simulation date. \n",
    "There are two main effect that determine the credit exposure over time for a single transaction or for a portfolio of transactions with the same counterparty: diffusion and amortization. As time passes, the \"diffusion effect\" tends to increase the exposure, since there is greater potential for market price factors (such as the FX or interest rates) to move significantly away from current levels; the \"amortization effect\", in contrast, thends to decrease the exposure over time, because it reduces the remaining cash flows that are exposed to default.\n",
    "These two effects acts in opposite directions (the diffusion effect increase the credit exposure and the amortization effect decreases it over time). For single cash products, such as FX forward, the potential exposure peaks at the maturity of the transaction, because it is driven purely by diffusion effect. On the other hand for products with multiple cash flows, such as interest rate swaps, the potential exposure usually peack at one-third to one-half of the way into the life of the transaction."

    "In this section we explore the well known result that the component of the IRS price due to counterparty risk is the sum of swaption prices with different maturities, each weighted with the probability of defaulting around that maturity. Let us suppose that we are a dault free counterparty \"B\" entering a payer swap with a defaultable counterparty \"C\", exchanging fixed for floating payments at times $T_{a+1},\\dots,T_b$. Denote by $\\beta_i$ the year fraction between $T_{i-1}$ and $T_i$, and by $P(t, T_i)$ the default-free zero coupon bond price at time $t$ for maturity $T_i$. We take a unit notional on the swap. The contract requires us to pay a fixed rate $K$ and to receive the floating rate $L$ resetting one period earlier until the default time $\\tau$ of \"B\" or until final maturity $T$ if $\\tau > T$. The fair forward-swap rate $K$ at a given time $t$ in a default-free market is the one which renders the swap zero-valued in $t$. \n",
