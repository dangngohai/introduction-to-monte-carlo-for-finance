Downloading Jupyter notebooks from GitHub 
_____________________________________________________________________

When you download an ipynb file using the RAW button in GitHub it 
displays the text int the browser. This is json code and contains 
all of the jupyter notebook cells. You can copy this text into a 
file and name it with the extension ipynb and it will contain the
notebook when using it with Jupyter.
